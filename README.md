# StartApp Text Classification Challenge

## Objective
A basic task in classifying mobile applications is to group them into different categories, with the further
purpose of identifying similarities between them in order to understand user behavior.
In this task, we intend to create a service which classifies applications to groups (segments), based on the
description given by the app creator.

## Setup

1. create a conda environment:
`conda create â€”n ac python=2`

2. activate your environment:
`source activate ac`

3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. in order to access the notebooks, run:
`jupyter notebook --ip='*' --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root`

## Start the service

1. `cd service`
2. `python app.py`
